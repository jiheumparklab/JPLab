                                    <strong>EHRs represent a large-scale but underutilized resource for early detection.</strong> As routinely collected data sources, EHRs capture longitudinal trajectories of diagnoses, medications, procedures, laboratory results, and healthcare utilization. These data can reveal prediagnostic signals and enable personalized risk profiling at scale. Compared to many other emerging early detection technologies such as advanced biosensors, digital imaging, and blood-based liquid biopsy tests, which often face barriers including sample collection requirements, high cost, and limited coverage, EHRs are non-invasive, low-cost, and already embedded in routine clinical care. Leveraging EHRs as a first-line or complementary tool could transform early detection and expand equitable access, particularly in underserved populations.

                                    <strong>Foundation models enable powerful new ways to learn from EHR data.</strong> Recent advances in large-scale representation learning have unlocked the potential to derive predictive signals from complex longitudinal health records. Analogous to how large language models such as ChatGPT are trained on vast amounts of text to generate broadly useful representations of language, EHR foundation models are trained on longitudinal patient trajectories to capture transferable clinical representations that can generalize across prediction tasks. Our preliminary work demonstrates that such models substantially improve cancer risk prediction compared with traditional supervised approaches, across multiple cancer types and health systems. These findings establish the feasibility of a unified, scalable, and generalizable EHR-based early detection system.

                                    <strong>Conversational AI can enhance interpretability and clinician trust.</strong> Despite substantial gains in predictive accuracy, clinical adoption of AI models remains limited because outputs are often distorted by noise or bias in underlying data and explained in ways that fail to earn clinician trust. Traditional explainability tools (e.g., SHAP, LIME, DeepLift) frequently surface institution-specific artifacts rather than clinically meaningful factors, while manual feature curation is unsustainable and risks omitting useful signals. To bridge this gap, clinicians need explanations that are both transparent and actionable, reflecting model reasoning in the context of real patient data. Our approach links an EHR foundation model with a conversational interface that generates SOAP-formatted summaries and dialogue-based explanations grounded in the patient timelines used by the model, model-derived features, risk scores, and clinical notes. This allows clinicians to explore why a patient was flagged as high risk, cross-check model predictions with evidence documented in clinical notes, and determine whether predictions are clinically reasonable. This methodological study aligns with Aim 2's retrospective counterfactual analysis, which identifies and thresholds high-risk cohorts, by evaluating whether clinician interaction with the interface can further refine these cohorts to enrich true positives and reduce false positives. By combining structured and unstructured data within an interactive, clinician-facing interface, this system transforms static model outputs into interpretable, evidence-linked explanations, an essential step toward safe and trustworthy clinical deployment of predictive models for early detection.

                                    <strong>We develop data-driven frameworks to guide safer and more individualized cancer treatment decisions.</strong> Treatment decisions for cancer patients are complex and often influenced by subtle clinical factors that are difficult to capture with traditional approaches. Using longitudinal EHR data from CUIMC, we are developing predictive tools that estimate the risk of treatment-related adverse events based on each patient's clinical history. By integrating large-scale propensity score methods and interaction analyses, we identify clinical profiles associated with safer or riskier responses to chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and targeted therapies. We aim to translate findings into clinically meaningful guidance for selecting treatment strategies tailored to individual patients.

                                    <strong>We use genomic foundation models to improve variant interpretation and enhance risk prediction across diverse populations.</strong> Genetic and genomic information offers powerful insights into disease susceptibility, but many variants remain difficult to interpret in clinical practice. Our lab explores genomic foundation models that learn evolutionary and structural constraints across hundreds of mammalian genomes to better characterize disease-associated variants. Building on recent work in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and Lynch syndrome, we generate individual-level genetic embeddings that improve risk prediction across diverse populations and help clarify variants of uncertain significance. We also integrate genomic and EHR-derived representations to identify individuals who may benefit from confirmatory germline testing, supporting earlier detection and more proactive precision medicine strategies.
